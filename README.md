# ERCNN-DRS Urban Change Monitoring
This project hosts the Ensemble of Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Deep Remote Sensing (ERCNN-DRS) used for urban change monitoring with ERS-1/2 & Landsat 5 TM, and Sentinel 1 & 2 remote sensing mission pairs. It was developed for demonstration purposes in the ESA BLENDED<sup>1</sup> project.

This research was funded by ESA via the Blockchain ENabled DEep Learning for Space Data (BLENDED) project (SpaceApps Subcontract No. 4000129481/19/I-IT4I), and by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports from the National Programme of Sustainability (NPS II) project "IT4Innovations excellence in science - LQ1602" and by the IT4Innovations infrastructure whichsupported from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic through the e-INFRA CZ (ID:90140) via Open Access Grant Competition (OPEN-21-31).

The authors would like to thank ESA for funding of the study as part of the BLENDED project<sup>1</sup> and IT4Innovations for funding the compute resources via the Open Access Grant Competition (OPEN-21-31). Furthermore, the authors would like to thank the data providers (USGS, ESA, Sentinel Hub and Google) for making remote sensing data freely available.  The authors would finally like to thank the BLENDED project partners for supporting our work as study case of the developed platform.
